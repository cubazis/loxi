## Loxi - a Lox Interpreter written in C

**Lox** is a dynamically typed, object oriented programming language, that supports first class functions and single inheritance.
It is described in the *[Crafting Interpreters][]* book by [Bob Nystrom], in which he builds a full Lox interpreter [jlox][] written in Java.

**Loxi** is a complete **C** implementation of the Lox interpreter.
